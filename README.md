# Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) Progression: Cell Clustering & Ligand-Receptor Interaction Inference

This multi-omics project investigates significant tumor-immune interactions associated with progressive changes from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive breast cancer. I am utilizing data visualization and statistical inference packages including Seurat, LIANA+, and NicheNet to cluster immune cells by type with high granularity onto UMAP plots, then integrating various hypothesis-free inference to identify ligand-receptor interactions with differential expressions in progressive versus non-progressive tissues.
